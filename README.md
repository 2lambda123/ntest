# NTest

Testing framework for rust which enhances the built-in library with some useful features. Inspired by the .Net unit-testing framework [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit). 

If you want to write assertions based on constrains, such as `assert_that!(1, is(equal_to(1)));` , checkout the [hamcrest](https://github.com/ujh/hamcrest-rust) or [spectra](https://github.com/cfrancia/spectral) library.
